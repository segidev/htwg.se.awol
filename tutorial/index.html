    <h2>Edit build.sbt to set up your own app</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="#code/build.sbt"
         class="shortcut">build.sbt</a> contains the build configuration; you'll
         want to change the project name, organization and version, to start.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many templates contain tutorials but this seed template is just intended
        as a starting point for creating a new app.
